# Habbit v1

Have you ever had one of those days where you feel like doing nothing? Like you just cant be bothered to get out of bed for anything? Then you remember you have to feed the dog, or your cat, or bird, or maybe even child?
Because without you, that thing that relies on you for food, shelter, and love, would die.

Habbit is a new sort of tool to help its users organize their time and stay on task by utilizing the feeling that something else's wellbeing is dependant upon them.

Habbit takes tasks chosen by the user and assigns them value, which upon completion awards currency to the user.
This currency is then used to buy food, medicine, and other items which are integral to the wellbeing of their pet, the Habbit.

The idea is that people care more about a task or chore if someone is depending on them, and it is the core principle behind Habbit, and the motivation for the user to complete the tasks they set out for themselves.

Habbit is a full stack web application made primarily in REACT with front end styling done in MATERIALIZE.
We used a mix of Yarn and NPM technologies, with a server built using EXPRESS and MONGOOSE for the db.
